  </section>
  <ol>
    <li>Add codesy to your browser.
    <li>When you visit a bug, you'll see a codesy form with two questions:
    <ul>
      <li>How much will you offer for a fix?</li>
      <li>How much do you ask to fix it yourself?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bid your amounts.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We'll combine all the offers until they match an asking price, then notify the matching coder to fix the bug and collect their earnings.</p>
