<h1>Router Sharing</h1>
<p>Many existing routers feature the ability to create guest networks. We have compiled a list of wireless routers with this functionality and have put together general tutorials to help you (a) change your administrative password and (b) create an open guest network.</p>

<p>If your router isn't in the supported list, there are two other things you can try. The easier way is to use a second router (maybe you have an old one sitting around somewhere) configured to be open, chained in front of or behind your WPA2 router with an ethernet cable (in front is slightly better for security; behind may let you do rate limiting or bandwidth quotas on the open router if the device supports it). The other way is to try to find open source firmware (such as OpenWRT or another firmware image) that runs on your router; installing custom firmware may require at least a moderate level of technical skill.</p>
